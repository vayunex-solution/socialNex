## 🏆 TIER 1 — Must-Have (Parity with Competitors)

These features are **expected** by users. Without them, SocialNex loses to Buffer/Hootsuite.

### 1. 📅 Smart Post Scheduler
**What:** Schedule posts for a future date/time with AI-suggested "Best Time to Post"
- Drag-and-drop visual calendar view (week/month)
- Queue system: set a weekly schedule, just add content
- Timezone auto-detection for global audiences
- Recurring posts (post same content every Monday at 9am)

**Why it's critical:** This is the #1 reason people use Buffer/Later. Without scheduling, SocialNex is just a "post now" tool.

**Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐ Medium

---

### 2. 📊 Analytics & Insights Dashboard
**What:** Track how your posts perform across all platforms
- Engagement metrics: likes, shares, comments, reach per post
- Growth tracking: follower count over time per platform
- Best performing content types (image vs text vs carousel)
- Export reports as PDF

**Why it's critical:** Users need to see if their posting strategy is working.

**Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High

---

### 3. 📝 Post Drafts & Templates
**What:** Save half-written posts as drafts, create reusable templates
- Draft auto-save (like Google Docs)
- Template library: "Product Launch", "Weekly Tips", "Behind the Scenes"

## 🔥 TIER 2 — Game-Changers (Beat Competitors)

These features put SocialNex **ahead** of Buffer and Later.

- Input: blog post, thread, or just a topic
- Output: 5-10 slide carousel with branded design
- Templates: minimal, bold, gradient, magazine-style
- Export as images ready for posting

**Why it's a game-changer:** Currently users pay $29/month SEPARATELY for PostNitro or Contentdrips. SocialNex would include this FREE.

**Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High

---

### 5. 🧵 AI Thread Generator
**What:** Convert any topic into a viral thread for X/Bluesky/LinkedIn
- Input: a topic or article URL
- Output: 5-15 tweet thread with hooks, insights, and CTA
- Hook templates: "Most people don't know this about...", "I spent 100 hours researching..."

### 6. ♻️ Content Repurposing Engine
**What:** One piece of content → posts for ALL platforms automatically
- Input: a blog post URL, YouTube video link, or podcast

- Trend matching: "This topic is trending right now, post within 2 hours"
- A/B testing: generate 3 variations, show predicted scores for each
